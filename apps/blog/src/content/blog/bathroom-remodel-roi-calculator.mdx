Bathroom remodels are the second most popular home improvement project, but with costs ranging from $6,000 to $35,000, it's crucial to understand your return on investment (ROI). This guide helps you calculate whether your bathroom renovation is worth it.

## The ROI Reality Check

**National Average ROI: 60-67%**

This means for every $10,000 spent, you'll recoup $6,000-$6,700 when selling. However, ROI varies dramatically based on:
- Scope of renovation
- Quality of materials
- Local real estate market
- Current bathroom condition

## Quick ROI Calculator

### Formula:
```
ROI = (Home Value Increase - Project Cost) / Project Cost × 100
```

### Example:
- Project Cost: $15,000
- Home Value Increase: $10,000
- ROI: ($10,000 - $15,000) / $15,000 × 100 = -33%

While this seems negative, remember: you're also gaining years of enjoyment and potentially avoiding costly repairs.
