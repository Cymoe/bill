Your HVAC system is one of your home's most expensive components, costing $5,000-$12,000 to replace. Regular maintenance can extend its life by 5-10 years and reduce energy bills by up to 30%. Here's your complete maintenance schedule.

## Why HVAC Maintenance Matters

**The Numbers Don't Lie:**
- Neglected systems fail 5-7 years early
- Annual maintenance saves $200-$500 in repairs
- Well-maintained systems use 15-25% less energy
- Emergency repairs cost 2-3x more than scheduled service

## Monthly Tasks (DIY - 10 minutes)

### 1. Check & Change Air Filters
**Frequency:** Every 1-3 months
**Cost:** $10-$30 per filter

**How to check:**
- Remove filter and hold up to light
- If you can't see through it, replace it
- Pet owners: check monthly
- No pets: check every 2-3 months

**Filter Types & Ratings:**
- MERV 8: Basic filtration ($10-15)
- MERV 11: Better for allergies ($15-25)
- MERV 13: Best filtration ($20-30)

### 2. Visual System Inspection
**What to look for:**
- Ice on outdoor unit (summer)
- Debris around outdoor unit
- Unusual sounds or odors
- Water leaks near indoor unit

## Seasonal Maintenance Schedule

### Spring (March-April)

**AC Prep Checklist:**
1. **Clean outdoor unit:** Remove debris, trim vegetation 2 feet back
2. **Test cooling:** Run AC for 10 minutes, check for cool air
3. **Clean condensate drain:** Pour 1 cup bleach down drain
4. **Check refrigerant lines:** Look for damage or missing insulation
5. **Replace batteries:** In thermostat and carbon monoxide detectors

**Professional Service ($150-$300):**
- Refrigerant level check
- Electrical connection inspection
- Coil cleaning
- Capacitor testing

### Summer (June-August)

**Peak Season Care:**
1. **Monitor performance:** Track cooling effectiveness
2. **Clean vents:** Vacuum supply and return vents monthly
3. **Check drainage:** Ensure condensate line flows freely
