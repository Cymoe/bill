# Construction SaaS User Feedback
*Last Updated: May 22, 2025*

This document captures common user requests and pain points in construction/home service software applications that are often missed by major SaaS providers. Use this as a reference when developing new features for Bill-Breeze.

## Common User Requests Missing from Major Construction SaaS

### 1. Seamless Field-to-Office Communication
- **Pain Point**: Disconnection between field workers and office staff
- **User Request**: Real-time mobile access to project information without returning to office
- **Gap**: Most solutions fail to provide truly effective mobile functionality for field workers
- **Impact**: Delays in communication, duplicate data entry, and information silos

### 2. Simplified User Experience
- **Pain Point**: Overly complex interfaces with steep learning curves
- **User Request**: Powerful features without sacrificing usability
- **Gap**: Small to medium contractors find enterprise solutions overwhelming
- **Impact**: Low adoption rates, underutilization of features, resistance to digital transformation

### 3. Flexible Project Management for Smaller Operations
- **Pain Point**: Solutions built for large operations with dedicated project managers
- **User Request**: Scaled-down versions that don't sacrifice core functionality
- **Gap**: Lack of modular systems where users only pay for what they need
- **Impact**: Small contractors paying for unused features or abandoning software altogether

### 4. Better Integration Between Systems
- **Pain Point**: Disconnected systems requiring manual data transfer
- **User Request**: Seamless integration between financial and operational systems
- **Gap**: Estimating, scheduling, invoicing, and project management often exist in separate tools

### 5. Customizable Documentation and Reporting
- **Pain Point**: Standard templates don't match specific business workflows
- **User Request**: Create custom forms and reports without developer assistance
- **Gap**: Limited ability to generate compliance documentation quickly
- **Impact**: Time wasted adapting to software instead of software adapting to business

### 6. Client Communication Portals
- **Pain Point**: Lack of transparency for homeowners
- **User Request**: Simple ways to share updates, photos, and documents
- **Gap**: Many systems lack effective client-facing interfaces
- **Impact**: Increased client calls/emails for updates, lower client satisfaction
