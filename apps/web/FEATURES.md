# 🚀 Bill Breeze Features: Why Contractors Choose Us

## The Problem We Solve

Every contractor knows the pain: You spend more time creating estimates than actually doing the work. You're either:
- Starting from scratch every time (wasting hours)
- Using outdated spreadsheets (missing profitable items)
- Guessing at prices (leaving money on the table)
- Managing different tools for different trades (complexity nightmare)

**Bill Breeze changes everything.**
