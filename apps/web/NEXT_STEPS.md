## Technical Notes

### Database Performance
- Consider GIN index on attributes if filtering becomes slow
- Monitor query performance as service options grow
- Implement pagination for large option lists

### Architecture Decisions
- Keep materials_list as array (working well)
- Use JSONB attributes sparingly but effectively
- Maintain shared-to-custom pricing model

### Quality Standards
- All service options must have materials_list
- Attributes should follow industry conventions
- Pricing should reflect realistic market rates
- Descriptions must be contractor-friendly
