## 🔧 What You Need to Do

### 1. Set Up Resend Account
1. Go to https://resend.com and create an account
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Add your domain (billbreeze.com) to Resend for email sending
4. Verify the domain following Resend's instructions

### 2. Configure the API Key
Run this command with your actual Resend API key:
```bash
supabase secrets set RESEND_API_KEY=re_YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY_HERE
```

### 3. Update Email Domains (if needed)
If you're using a different domain than billbreeze.com:
- Update the Edge Function (`/supabase/functions/send-email/index.ts`)
- Update the EmailService (`/src/services/EmailService.ts`)
- Change `noreply@billbreeze.com` and `support@billbreeze.com` to your domain

## 📧 How to Use

### Sending an Estimate
1. Go to an estimate detail page
2. Click the status dropdown
3. Select "Send to Client" 
4. Confirm the email address
5. Email will be sent and status updated to "sent"

### Email Tracking
- When emails are sent, they're logged in the `email_logs` table
- The estimate/invoice status updates to "sent"
- Timestamps track when emails were first sent and last sent
- Send count tracks how many times an email was sent

### Coming Soon (Webhook Integration)
Once you have Resend webhooks configured:
- Track when emails are opened (update to "opened" status)
- Track email bounces and failures
- Get delivery confirmations

## 🧪 Testing

Test script created at `/test-email.js` to verify the Edge Function is working.

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Complete Resend setup** (steps above)
2. **Test sending an estimate** to verify everything works
3. **Set up Resend webhooks** (optional) for email tracking:
   - Webhook endpoint: `https://wnwatjwcjptwehagqiwf.supabase.co/functions/v1/send-email-webhook`
   - This will need to be implemented to track opens/bounces

## 🚨 Important Notes

- The Edge Function requires authentication (user must be logged in)
- Email sending is logged for audit purposes
- Failed email sends don't break the app (graceful error handling)
- All email addresses should be updated to your actual domain before production use

## 📊 Database Schema

### email_logs table
```sql
- id (uuid)
- entity_type (invoice/estimate)
- entity_id (reference to invoice/estimate)
- user_id (who sent it)
- organization_id (org context)
- recipient_email
- cc_emails[]
- subject
- status (sent/delivered/opened/bounced/failed)
- sent_at
- delivered_at
- opened_at
- bounced_at
- failed_at
- provider_message_id (Resend ID)
- provider_response (full response)
- metadata (jsonb for extra data)
```

### Invoice/Estimate Updates
